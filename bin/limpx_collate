=head1 NAME

limpx_collate - collate downloaded limpx info

=head1 USAGE

This collates every downloaded limpx topic:

    ./bin/limpx_collate

This collates selected course only:

    ./bin/limpx_collate /tmp/course.html

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

None yet by so far.

=head1 OPTIONS

Optional argument is the downloaded course file.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This binary reads every downloaded course file together with course
contents directory and files therein and puts their contents onto the
output files, one per topic inside the course directory.

This may or may not accept input course file as its argument. If no
course file supplied then every file listed in downloaded courses
directory is searched on topics and questions.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

On every in-text picture not found on server, the message should be
printed to standard error output.

On every real error, typically the disc i/o or text parsing error, the
message is printed to standard error output handle and binary exits with
non-zero exit code.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Every possible configuration tweak is supposed to be done via the
constants' statements. This includes but not limited to, directories to
read and write files.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This binary requires perl version 5.12 as the least. Required modules
are: L<lib::abs>, L<Const::Fast>, L<WWW::Mechanize::Gzip> et alumni.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

This stuff is made possible for (almost) any design or surf layout
change of downloaded files. Promblem is if you change semantic layout
then machine-readability of the outpot files will be the question.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This produces only the given output that consists of information usable
to read by human but most important by subsequent output formatter(s).
